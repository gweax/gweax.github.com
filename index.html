            I decided to put all my private projects on github. I did this for
            several reasons:
        </p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Others may benefit from my work. Gee, I am so altruistic.</li>
            <li>As a frontend developer, my work <em>is</em> open to anyone who
                is able to use viewsource or firebug (or by many other means).
                If they find my work... So why not put it somewhere, where
                people can find it and easily work with it.</li>
            <li>I may benefit from putting my projects on github. I have so many
                ideas for my projects, but not the time. So they just rot on my
                hard drive and never get published, because that important tiny
                little feature is not yet done. Maybe, if it's on github,
                someone else would want to contribute to my projects. Gee, I am
                so selfish :-)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>
            So. Here it is. The empty page for my projects. I hope to update it
            today (Feb 18 2012) to include the <strong>Formula 1 Alternative
            Point Scheme Calculator</strong>. Let's see, how long it actually
            takes me to move it from rotting on my hard drive to a working,
            documented project on github.
